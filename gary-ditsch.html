        <p>I completed my first marathon in May of 1999. While I felt that I had accomplished something great, there was a burning question:</p>

        <blockquote>"Can I run faster?"</blockquote>

        <p>That single question has lead to many of the goals that I have set ever since, whether in the classroom or the race course. As I continued to pursue endurance goals, I witnessed these pursuits impact many areas of my life. The goal of becoming "faster" lead me to realize that fitness and exercise were components of a complete style of living.<p>

        <p>My desire to pursue performance continues, although I value the benefit running has on my health and happiness more than any other benefit.</p>

        <p>My love of running and expertise as a coach as lead to many wonderful opportunities. I have been able to coach hundreds of runners to a finish line. This has including people finishing their first 5k, their 25th marathon, 600 km bike events, Ironman triathlons and other feats of endurance they felt compelled to achieve.</p>

        <p>The best part about being a coach is watching athletes completely surprise themselves, by accomplishing goals they once thought impossible.</p>
