Going into the race I felt pretty confident about the fitness levels that I had been able to obtain during the 12 week training cycle. The test races that we had scheduled went well and as I continued to taper, my heart rates were actually coming down compared to heart rates at similar running paces in the previous weeks. The built up fatigue was finally going away. And I did not have any lingering injuries. A person could not ask for much more from their training program.

<h3>Race Morning:</h3>

The morning was similar to the days of the test races. I was up 3.5 hours before the start and got my calories in. (3 Boost plus drinks.) I also started on my large cup of coffee. The only thing that happened that was different was how long the nerves affected my stomach. Luckily, this all subsided once we started running.

For the rest of the report, I am going to compare what happened to the race strategy that I developed for the race.

<h3>Miles: 1 to 6</h3>  
This part of the course was through Iroquois, which was the most difficult terrain. The strategy was to go out conservative, which I did. The first mile was casual and easy, which was a little difficult due to all of the mini-marathon runners flying by. As I passed the first mile mark, I noticed that my time was 7:35. Whoa? I knew I was taking it easy, but that was a little extreme. I was running with Gene from Todd's Road, so I told him I was going to run a little quicker. (I think he stayed close by, because I ran with him a little more).

At the six mile mark, my time was about right on with the 42 minute split I wanted to hit. The hills through Iroquois were not as challenging as they had been during the Papa Johns 10 miler. I think that it was probably due to the weather and due to the fact I was running 40 seconds a mile slower.

<h3>Miles: 6 to 13</h3>  
I wrote in the race strategy that these miles were flat and they were. The only change was due to the entrance and exit from Churchill Downs. I did not really push the pace during this portion, because I felt really comfortable. In retrospect, this was probably a mistake. My pace from the 15k to 25k (9.3mile to 15.5 mile) marks was 6:55. I really should have been around 6:50 during this time period, taking advantage of the favorable and flat roads.

As I went through the 10 mile mark I was 30 seconds slower than the 1:09:10 split I wanted to hit.

<h3>Miles: 13 to 20</h3>
I really believe that I miscalculated the difficulty of this portion of the race, in regards to the rolling hills. I thought that once we got to Cherokee Park we would have finished most of the hills, but that was not true. It is true that getting to Cherokee Park was rolling and a little challenging, but it was not over there. After running downhill for quite a while through the park, there were several stretches of long uphill climbs. The climbs were not as drastic as the Iroquois climbs, but they did come at the make-or-break portion of a marathon.

<h3>How lonely can a runner be?</h3>
The absolute worst part about this section of the race was how lonely I got. The mini-marathon runners break off around mile 12, which depletes the participants by a lot. During this segment, I remember passing one runner around 13.5. After that exchange, I could not see anyone ahead. Between mile 15 and 16, I came around a corner and passed another runner, but that too was a brief moment.

Other than those two runners, I only saw one other guy. He was far enough ahead that I could occasionally see him if the stretch of road was fairly straight, but I was not making up any ground. Finally, around mile 20 two runners passed me, but they made pretty quick work of getting by. And there was not any exchange of pleasantries at this point.

I am not sure that I was prepared to run alone. Looking back, I wish that I had practiced what I preached even more. I had a lot of positive self-talk going, but my positive visualization was weak. More practice would have made them stronger.

<h3>Mile 20 Split</h3>
Here is a quote from my pre-race strategy]

> The 20 mile mark is key. If I feel good then working miles 20 to 24 will determine if I can make it under 3 hours. If I do not feel good then I will stay steady, hope for the best and live with the time they day gave me.

I came to the 20 mile mark a little more than 2 minutes behind the split I had set (2:17:30). Sometimes at this point in a race the brain is not working as well as it should, but I quickly calculated what I would have to do to make up 2 mins in 6 miles. 20 seconds per mile. Since my goal pace was 6:52, I realized that I would have to run around a 6:30 pace for the last 10k to make up the time. That was not going to happen.

I said I would take what the day gave me, but that is easier said than done. I had put so much effort (mentally and physically) into the 3 hour goal, that I felt a dramatic shift in my perception of the day at this point. My pace through 30k (18.6 miles) was 6:57. (Split taken from the race result chip timing) My overall pace for the day was 7:12. Most people looking at those times would say that I hit the wall, but I do not believe I did.

What did happen was that I started to lose the desire to push the pain threshold. Running the miles from 20 to 23 were extremely difficult, not from a fitness perspective, but from a motivation standpoint. The one positive to the race was that there were other runners around as we crossed over the river from Kentucky to Indiana. Unfortunately, one of those runners ahead was taking walking breaks every 100 to 200 yards. "Not a bad idea," I thought.

<h3>The Pain</h3>  
Having not run a marathon for time since 2003, I think the pain was the most difficult part of the race. I forgot what it meant to run while being in complete pain and knowing that I was not going to make my goal made it all the more difficult. As a runner, one lesson that I learned from this race was that consistent racing is important. Knowing what challenges are ahead is one thing, experiencing it is a whole different story.

<h3>Get it together man!</h3>
It was about the time that I headed towards the bridge to run into Indiana that I thought about all of the people that have helped me along this 12-week journey. I thought about the Tuesday / Thursday runs, the Saturday morning runs at Todd's road and my clients flexibility that allowed me to do the races and training runs I needed to prepare. I also thought about all the people following along the training process by reading my blog. But the biggest boost in my effort came from an email I received from John Reier earlier in the week. Just the knowledge that someone who spent so much time supporting my athletic life in my childhood still maintained interest in my athletic pursuits allowed me to decide not to walk and try to pull the race together.

<h3>Making it to the finish.</h3>
I actually felt like I put together a pretty good finish (or last couple miles). The last few hundred yards was interesting because I was trying to push through the pain (and at this point going sub 3:10) while running and dodge the walkers that were finishing the mini-marathon.

Finish time: 3:08:51. This time will get me to Boston if I decide to go, but as I have mentioned in a previous post, I do not anticipate making that trip. But with Nikki's great race, she might qualify sometime soon too, so we might have to make that trip together?

<h3>Summary of the lessons learned</h3>
1. conservative pacing to begin a marathon is still the way to go  
2. having specific splits you want to achieve breaks the race up, but does not require that you obsess about every mile  
3. consistent racing at the designated distance is valuable experience is golden  
4. mental training (visualization, meditation, etc) is more valuable than even I have promoted it  
5. nutrition is important (and I really benefited from the eGel's.. note: in the race strategy I called them eFuel's?)  
6. making your goals known is a powerful motivator (but sharing with the entire world creates a good deal of anxiety!)  
7. having a good group to train with is essential at times, but learning to run alone is also valuable.

<h3>7 Down!</h3>
Well that is it for the race report, but one thing that I would like to share is that the Derby Festival Marathon completes my 7th state in my attempt at finishing a marathon in all 50 States and DC.
