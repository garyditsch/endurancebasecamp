There are different types of strength training programs that a runner could start, such as circuit training, power training, muscle building, etc. I thought that it might be beneficial to look at two things.

1. What amount of repetitions / sets achieve what goal?  
2. What amount of repetitions / sets are valuable for the runner?

<h3>What amount of repetitions / sets achieve what goal?</h3>

A common belief that goes along with strength training is that to develop strength, you need to build oversized or large muscles. Those bigger and heavier muscles are not all that beneficial for running. But to develop strength that is useful for the runner, bigger muscles is not the goal.

Here are some general strength training guidelines around sets, reps and the suggested outcome:

- Strength: 6 or less reps, 2 to 6 sets
- Hypertrophy (building muscle size): 6 to 12 reps, 3 to 6 sets
- Muscular Endurance: 12 or more reps, 2 to 3 sets

<h3>What amount of repetitions / sets are valuable for the runner?</h3>

If you read my post, **Improve your running performance by including strength training**, then you will already know that the article I reviewed highlighted the benefits of heavy resistance training and explosive training. Another review that I found, **The Impact of Resistance Training on Distance Running Performance** also came to similar conclusions. Here are the highlights:

1. Circuit training (higher reps, lower rest) showed some benefit for untrained subjects, but no benefit for trained runners. The observed improvements in the untrained runners is likely due to changes in VO2max and lactate threshold, these changes will not occur in runners that are already training because the circuit training is not enough of a stimulus.

2. Traditional resistance training (squats, etc.) has proved beneficial for trained and untrained subject's performance. Improved running economy is likely the reason for improved performance in the trained runners group.

3. Heavy resistance training improved both long-term and short-term endurance for trained and untrained subjects.

4. Explosive resistance training (plyometrics) improved running economy and running performance (5k) when added to a distance running program.

<h3>What does this mean? For the experienced runner.</h3>

This review provides some evidence that experienced and trained runners could benefit by adding in a period of strength training that includes heavy resistance sets and explosive exercises.

How long of a period? My suggestion would be to include 4 to 12 weeks depending on your schedule of events and experience with strength training.

If you are an experienced runner but new to strength training, I would also suggest going through a period of circuit training (see above) before you take on a heavy resistance program. Even if you will not see any running performance benefits from the circuit training, you will be less likely to injure yourself by jumping straight into a highly intense strength training program.

<h3>What does this mean? For the novice runner.</h3>

It means you would be better off running more often, more minutes and with some added intensity. As a new runner there are a lot of gains waiting for you through running. So if you are still improving by running, run a little more and rest.

The one topic not addressed here would be the inclusion of strength training for the specific purpose of injury prevention. That is a larger topic for another post, however the short lesson would be to always be thinking about having good mobility and stability, so you can continue to run.
